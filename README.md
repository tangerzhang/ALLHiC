# ALLHiC
ALLHiC: phasing and scaffolding polyploid genomes based on Hi-C data  
See wiki for details (https://github.com/tangerzhang/ALLHiC/wiki).
# Note
Please be aware that ALLHiC is no longer maintained. We recommend using two recently released algorithm packages developed by our team, which are reference-free and much faster: 
- **C-Phasing**: [C-Phasing GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wangyibin/CPhasing)  
- **HapHiC**: [HapHiC GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zengxiaofei/HapHiC)
